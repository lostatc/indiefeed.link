# IndieFeed.link

This is a website that acts as a landing page for your blog's syndication feed
(RSS or Atom).

Many blogs will include a link to their feed somewhere on the page to advertise
that they have one, but clicking these links brings users to an ugly XML
document that they might not know what to do with.

As an alternative, you can link to this site instead:

```
https://indiefeed.link/feed/<your_feed_url>
```

Users are brought to a page that shows a preview of the articles from your feed
and allows them to easily copy the feed URL into their RSS reader. Much nicer.
